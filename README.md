## Abstract
<div align="left">
  <p align="justify">
    Two-factor authentication (2FA) systems involve the use of multiple electronic devices and network infrastructure. Server GET/POST requests add up, contributing to 
    cumulative energy usage. Other environmental drawbacks of 2FA are (1) they rely on data centers, so they leave a large carbon footprint; (2) sometimes they involve physical
    hardware tokens, smart cards, or paper, which results in transportation costs and physical waste. To mitigate many of these environmental concerns, we created a 2FA system that
    only uses one device. The web platform verifies a user's identity by generating a custom biometric profile based on a user's typing patterns. Next, the system verifies a user is
    who they say they are by providing a stats-based API for other web platforms. No Duo Mobile required!
