# AuthDaddy: 2FA Using Biometric Data

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Explore%20the%20Code-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Mahajanet/AuthDaddy)

AuthDaddy is a groundbreaking Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) solution developed during PennApps XXIV (2023). Unlike traditional 2FA systems that rely on multiple electronic devices and complex network infrastructure, AuthDaddy simplifies the authentication process by harnessing a user's unique biometric typing patterns. This innovative approach not only enhances security but also addresses critical environmental concerns associated with conventional 2FA methods.

## Abstract

AuthDaddy revolutionizes the concept of 2FA by eliminating the need for additional electronic devices and complex infrastructure. Traditional 2FA methods often result in excessive energy consumption due to server GET/POST requests, leaving a substantial carbon footprint. Moreover, they frequently involve physical tokens or smart cards, contributing to transportation costs and environmental waste.

### How It Works

AuthDaddy's innovative approach to 2FA relies on the following key principles:

1. **Biometric Typing Patterns**: AuthDaddy generates a highly secure and custom biometric profile based on a user's unique typing patterns. This profile serves as a reliable identifier.

2. **Stats-Based API**: The system provides a statistics-based API that seamlessly integrates with various web platforms. This API enables other web services to verify a user's identity without the need for traditional 2FA methods.

### Technologies Used

AuthDaddy was developed using a powerful combination of technologies, including:

- **MATLAB**: MATLAB was instrumental in processing and analyzing the biometric typing patterns, ensuring the accuracy and security of user identification.

- **JavaScript (JS)**: JavaScript played a crucial role in developing the interactive web platform, allowing users to seamlessly interact with AuthDaddy.

- **HTML and CSS**: HTML and CSS were used to create the user interface, providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

These technologies were vital in creating a robust and user-friendly 2FA solution.

### Advantages

AuthDaddy offers numerous advantages:

- **Sustainability**: By reducing the reliance on additional hardware and minimizing server requests, AuthDaddy significantly decreases energy consumption and carbon emissions, making it an eco-friendly solution.

- **User-Friendly**: Users are not burdened with the need for external devices or mobile apps, enhancing the user experience.

- **Security**: Biometric typing patterns offer a robust and personalized authentication method, enhancing security.
