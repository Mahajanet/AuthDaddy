# AuthDaddy: 2FA Using Biometric Data

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Explore%20the%20Code-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Mahajanet/AuthDaddy)

AuthDaddy is a cutting-edge Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) solution developed during PennApps XXIV (2023). Unlike traditional 2FA systems that rely on multiple electronic devices and network infrastructure, AuthDaddy simplifies the authentication process by utilizing a user's unique biometric typing patterns. This innovative approach not only enhances security but also addresses environmental concerns associated with conventional 2FA methods.

## Abstract

AuthDaddy revolutionizes the concept of 2FA by eliminating the need for additional electronic devices and infrastructure. Traditional 2FA methods often lead to excessive energy consumption due to server GET/POST requests. They also contribute to a large carbon footprint as they rely on data centers and involve physical tokens or smart cards, resulting in transportation costs and waste.

AuthDaddy's innovative approach leverages biometric data to verify a user's identity efficiently and sustainably. Here's how it works:

1. **Biometric Typing Patterns**: AuthDaddy generates a custom biometric profile based on a user's typing patterns. This unique profile serves as a secure identifier.

2. **Stats-Based API**: The system provides a statistics-based API that can be integrated with various web platforms. This API allows other web services to verify a user's identity without the need for traditional 2FA methods.

With AuthDaddy, no additional hardware or mobile apps like Duo Mobile are required, making it a user-friendly and environmentally conscious 2FA solution.
